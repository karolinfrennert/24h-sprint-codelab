# 24h sprint

Build your own passion project in 24h

I love to code and I want to share this passion with other people. The best way for me to do that is to create a website where people, no matter your background can come together and learn how to code

I decided to name this projecr codeLab, as coding is about trying out new things and testing what works. 

###This project should include the following:
*Loading times
*Creating trust
*Removing clutter
*CTA-buttons
*Clear navigation
*Make a user follow a journey

*Remember - be wild - you're a student.âœ¨*
